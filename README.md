### LEARNING JPA RELATIONSHIPS

After finished backend part of udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-using-intellij-build-a-real-world-project) 
before moving forward with frontend part decided to split what I've learned into smaller blocks
and try to improve my skills by making simplified projects by myself.

This project is about handling oneToOne, OneToMany and vice versa and ManyToMany relationships with JPA. 
Also covering topics like custom exceptions, cascading, DTOs (data transfer objects) and customizing swagger documentation. 

Picked very "original" model, but it covers everything what I needed:
